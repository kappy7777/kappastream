## About

kappastream is a native Linux client for watching Twitch without signing in or handing an application your Twitch credentials.

It is designed for people who want to open a stream, read the real chat, and get out of the way. There is no login flow, social feed, recommendation engine, account integration, or kappastream backend.

Chat is read anonymously through Twitch IRC. Stream playback is resolved locally with [streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) and played through `hls.js`. Favorites, settings, notifications, themes, and cached state remain on your device.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Live playback** | HLS playback with quality selection, fullscreen, theater mode, per-channel quality preferences, and an optional low-latency mode. |
| **Anonymous chat** | Read-only Twitch IRC chat with native Twitch emotes, 7TV, BTTV and FFZ emotes, badges, colored usernames, timestamps, and mention highlighting. |
| **Favorites** | Save channels locally, drag to reorder them, and see live status, viewer count, game, and stream title at a glance. |
| **Notifications** | Opt in per channel for go-live notifications and receive desktop alerts for chat mentions. |
| **Picture-in-Picture** | A borderless floating player that maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio and remembers its position. |
| **mpv handoff** | Open the current stream in a standalone `mpv` player through streamlink. |
| **System tray** | Show, hide, or quit from the tray, with optional close-to-tray behavior. |
| **Customization** | 29 themes and interface scaling from 0.5× to 4×. |
| **Import and export** | Back up and restore favorites and settings as local JSON files. |
| **Resilient status checks** | Cached state, retry backoff, and rate-limit protection keep temporary API failures from disrupting playback or chat. |

## Installation

### Arch Linux

Install the prebuilt package from the AUR:

```bash
yay -S kappastream-bin
```

To build the latest development version from source instead:

```bash
yay -S kappastream-git
```

Other AUR helpers can be used in place of `yay`.

### AppImage

1. Install `streamlink` using your distribution's package manager.
2. Download the AppImage and `SHA256SUMS` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
3. Make the AppImage executable and launch it:

```bash
chmod +x kappastream*.AppImage
./kappastream*.AppImage
```

> [!NOTE]
> **For the best experience, use a native package whenever your distribution is supported.**
>
> The AppImage is provided as a portable fallback, but it may offer worse startup time, UI responsiveness, video performance, desktop integration, and hardware compatibility than the native AUR, DEB, or RPM packages. This is because it bundles its own WebKitGTK and GStreamer runtime while still interacting with the host system’s graphics drivers and desktop environment.
>
> Arch Linux, Debian/Ubuntu, and Fedora users are therefore strongly encouraged to install the corresponding native package below. Use the AppImage mainly when no suitable native package is available or when you specifically need a portable build.

### Debian and Ubuntu

Download the `.deb` package from the [latest release](../../releases/latest), then install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install ./kappastream_*_amd64.deb
```

The package declares `streamlink` as a dependency.

### Fedora

Twitch streams use H.264 video. Fedora's default `ffmpeg-free` packages do not include the required H.264 decoder, so the **RPM Fusion Free** repository must be enabled first.

Enable RPM Fusion Free once:

```bash
sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```

Then download the `.rpm` package from the [latest release](../../releases/latest) and install it with:

```bash
sudo dnf install --allowerasing ./kappastream-*.x86_64.rpm
```

The `--allowerasing` option allows DNF to replace Fedora's codec-stripped `ffmpeg-free` libraries with RPM Fusion's `ffmpeg-libs`, which provides H.264 playback. Without the codec, streams may play audio over a black video surface.

The package also declares `streamlink` as a dependency.

If kappastream was installed before the codec dependency was added, repair the existing installation with:

```bash
sudo dnf swap --allowerasing ffmpeg-free ffmpeg
```

## streamlink

kappastream uses [streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) as a local helper to resolve Twitch streams.

The `.deb` and `.rpm` packages install it as a dependency. AppImage users must install it separately:

```bash
sudo pacman -S streamlink       # Arch Linux
sudo apt install streamlink     # Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dnf install streamlink     # Fedora
pip install --user streamlink   # Python fallback
```

If `streamlink` is installed outside your normal `PATH`, set its location before starting kappastream:

```bash
STREAMLINK_BIN=/opt/bin/streamlink ./kappastream.AppImage
```

kappastream reports a clear error when the binary cannot be found.

## Privacy

kappastream has no server, account system, analytics, telemetry, advertising SDK, cloud sync, or crash-reporting service.

Your favorites, settings, notification preferences, cached status, and other application state are stored locally. Nothing is uploaded to a kappastream service because no such service exists.

### Network access

The application contacts only the services required for playback, chat, metadata, and emotes:

| Component or service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Twitch IRC** — `irc-ws.chat.twitch.tv` | Read anonymous chat messages |
| **streamlink** — local process | Resolve the selected Twitch stream |
| **Twitch video infrastructure** — `twitch.tv`, `ttvnw.net` | Deliver video playlists and media segments |
| **Twitch static CDN** — `static-cdn.jtvnw.net` | Load native emotes and chat badges |
| **Twitch GQL** — `gql.twitch.tv` | Primary source for favorites live status, viewer count, title, game, avatar, and Twitch user-ID lookup |
| **7TV, BTTV and FFZ** | Load third-party emotes |
| **DecAPI** | Fallback for live status when GQL is unreachable (network error / non-2xx / timeout) |

These third-party services can see normal request info like your IP address — never your Twitch account, an OAuth token, or your profile.

**Data sources.** Favorites load through one batched, anonymous Twitch request per refresh. DecAPI is only used if that fails.

kappastream does not use Twitch Helix or Kraken and cannot authenticate as you.

## Verifying releases

Release packages are built by GitHub Actions from the repository source. The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) and its [public build logs](../../actions) can be inspected directly.

Each release includes a `SHA256SUMS` file covering the published AppImage, Debian package, RPM package, and AUR binary archive.

Download the artifacts into the same directory and verify them with:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

A successful result confirms that the downloaded file matches the checksum published with the release. Checksums detect corruption or replacement after publication; they are not a substitute for reviewing the source and build workflow.


## Known limitations

- **Linux only.** kappastream currently targets X11 and Wayland; no Windows or macOS builds are provided.
- **streamlink is required.** Playback cannot be resolved without the local helper binary.
- **Read-only by design.** Sending chat messages, following, subscribing, redeeming channel points, and other authenticated Twitch features are intentionally outside the project's scope.

## Build from source

### Requirements

- Linux
- Node.js 22 or a compatible current release
- Rust stable
- `streamlink`
- The [Tauri 2 Linux prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)
- WebKitGTK 4.1, GTK 3, Soup 3, librsvg, and Ayatana AppIndicator development packages

On Debian or Ubuntu, the build dependencies used by CI are:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  libsoup-3.0-dev \
  librsvg2-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  patchelf
```

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kappy7777/kappastream.git
cd kappastream

npm ci
npm run check
npm run build
npm run tauri -- build --bundles appimage
```

The AppImage is written to:

```text
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/
```

The first Rust build can take considerably longer than subsequent builds.

## Technology

- **Tauri 2 and Rust** — native shell, window management, subprocess handling, notifications, tray integration, and Linux packaging
- **Svelte 5 and TypeScript** — user interface and local application state
- **Vite** — frontend compilation
- **hls.js** — HLS playback
- **Twitch IRC over WebSocket** — anonymous, read-only chat
- **streamlink** — local stream resolution
- **WebKitGTK** — system webview, avoiding a bundled Chromium runtime
